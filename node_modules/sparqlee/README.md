A simple spec-compliant SPARQL 1.1 expression evaluator library.

This package is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sparqlee), type definitions are provided.

## Using Sparqlee

```ts
const expression = ...some sparql algebra expression...;
const bindings = ...some bindings/solution mapping...;
const config = ...sparqlee config and optional context...;

// Create an evaluator (a sync evaluator will exist in the future too)
const evaluator = new AsyncEvaluator(expression, config);

// evaluate it as a term
const result: RDF.Term = await evaluator.evaluate(bindings);

// or evaluate it as an Effective Boolean Value (for e.g in FILTER)
const result: boolean = await evaluator.evaluateAsEBV(bindings);

```

Note: If you want to use *aggregates*, or *exists* you should check out the [stream section](#streams).

### Config

Sparqlee accepts an optional config argument, that is not required for simple use cases, but for feature completeness and spec compliance it should be populated fully.

```ts
interface AsyncEvaluatorConfig {
  now?: Date;
  baseIRI?: string;

  exists?: (expression: Alg.ExistenceExpression, mapping: Bindings) => Promise<boolean>;
  aggregate?: (expression: Alg.AggregateExpression) => Promise<RDF.Term>;
  bnode?: (input?: string) => Promise<RDF.BlankNode>;
}
```

See the [stream](#streams) and [context dependant function](#context_dependant_functions) sections for more info.

### Errors

Sparqlee exports an Error class called `ExpressionError` from which all SPARQL related errors inherit. These might include unbound variables, wrong types, invalid lexical forms, and much more. More info on errors [here](lib/util/Errors.ts). These errors can be caught, and may impact program execution in an expected way. All other errors are unexpected, and are thus programmer mistakes or mistakes in this library.

There is also the utility function `isExpressionError` for detecting these cases.

```ts
// Make sure to catch errors if you don't control binding input
try {
  const result = await evaluator.evaluate(bindings);
  consumeResult(result;)
} catch (error) {
  if (isExpressionError(error)) {
    console.log(error); // SPARQL related errors
    ...                 // Move on, ignore result, ...
  } else {
    throw error;        // Programming errors or missing features.
  }
}
```

### Exists

'Exists' operations are an annoying problem to tackle in the context of an expression evaluator, since they make the operation statefull and context dependant. They might span entire streams and, depending on the use case, have very different requirements for speed and memory consumption. Sparqlee has therefore decided to delegate this responsibility back to you.

You can, if you want, pass hooks to the evaluators of the shape:

```ts
exists?: (expression: Alg.ExistenceExpression, mapping: Bindings) => Promise<boolean>;
```

If Sparqlee encounters any or existence expression, it will call this hook with the relevant information so you can resolve it yourself. If these hooks are not present, but an existence expression is encountered, then an error is thrown.

An example consumer/hook can be found in [Comunica](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/blob/master/packages/actor-query-operation-filter-sparqlee/lib/ActorQueryOperationFilterSparqlee.ts).;

### Aggregates

We provide an `AggregateEvaluator` to which you can pass the individual bindings in the stream, end ask the aggregated result back. It uses Sparqlee's internal type system for operations such as `sum` and `avg`.

```ts
const stream = [bindings1, bindings2, bindings3];

if (stream.length === 0) {
  return AggregateEvaluator.emptyValue(aggregateExpression);
} else {
  const evaluator = = new AggregateEvaluator(aggregateExpression, bindings[0]);
  stream.slice(1).forEach((bindings) => evaluator.put(bindings));
  return evaluator.result();
}
```

We have not found any SPARQL Algebra for which this occurs, but we happen to find any aggregate expressions nested in the expression (or even at the top level), we will call (similarly to EXISTS) an aggregate hook you might have provided.

```ts
aggregate?: (expression: Alg.AggregateExpression) => Promise<RDF.Term>;
```

You can probably ignore this.

### Custom functions

**NOTE: Not yet implemented. On the roadmap.**

### Binary

Sparqlee also provides a binary for evaluating simple expressions from the command line. Example

```bash
# (npm binary)
$ sparqlee 'concat("foo", "bar")'
Literal {
  value: 'foobar',
  datatype: NamedNode { value: 'http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string' },
  language: '' }

# (in development)
$ node ./dist/bin/Sparqlee.js '7 + 3'
Literal {
  value: '10',
  datatype: NamedNode { value: 'http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer' },
  language: '' }
```

### Context dependant functions

Some functions (BNODE, NOW, IRI) need a (statefull) context from the caller to function correctly according to the spec. This context can be passed as an argument to Sparqlee (see the [config section](#config) for exact types). If they are not passed, Sparqlee will use a naive implementation that might do the trick for simple use cases.

#### BNODE

[spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#func-bnode)

Blank nodes are very dependant on the rest of the SPARQL query, therefore, we provide the option of delegating the entire responsibility back to you by accepting a blank node constructor callback. If this is not found, we will use uuid (v4) to generate definitely unique blank nodes of the shape `blank_uuid`.

`bnode(input?: string) => RDF.BlankNode`

#### Now

[spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#func-now)

All calls to now in a query must return the same value, since we aren't aware of the rest of the query, you can provide a timestamp (`now: Date`). If it's not present, Sparqlee will use the timestamp of evaluator creation, this at least allows evaluation with multiple bindings to have the same `now` value.

#### IRI

[spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#func-iri)

To be fully spec compliant, the IRI/URI functions should take into account base IRI of the query, which you can provide as `baseIRI: string` to the config.

## Spec compliance

**TODO** Add section about differences from the spec and which functions are affected (and which are implemented). See also [extensible value testing and error handling](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#extensionFunctions).

**Note about string literals:** See issue [#2 (simple literals are masked)](https://github.com/comunica/sparqlee/issues/2)

- _Implemented_: The function is at least partially implemented.
- _Tested_: There are tests for this function in this repo.
- _Passes spec_: Passes the spec tests (see [rdf-test-suite](https://github.com/rubensworks/rdf-test-suite.js)). We test this with [Comunica](https://github.com/comunica/comunica) and in `./test/spec`. A `?` signifies a dedicated spec test is missing, and it does not occur in any other test, an `I` indicates it has no dedicated spec test, but occurs indirectly in others.
- _Spec compliant_: Passes the spec tests, has local tests, and there is high confidence the function is fully spec compliant.

## Development

## Setup locally

1. Install `yarn` (or `npm`) and `node`.
2. Run `yarn install`.
3. Use these evident commands (or check `package.json`):
    - building once: `yarn run build`
    - build and watch: `yarn run watch`
    - testing: `yarn run test`
    - benchmarking: `yarn run bench`

### Adding or fixing functions

Functions are defined in the [functions directory](lib/functions/), and you can add or fix them there. All definitions are defined using a builder model defined in [Helpers.ts](lib/functions/Helpers.ts).

Three kinds exists:

- Regular functions: Functions with a uniform interface, that only need their arguments to calculate their result.
- Special functions: whose behaviour deviates enough from the norm to warrant the implementations taking full control over type checking and evaluation (these are mostly the functional forms).
- Named functions: which correspond to the SPARQLAlgebra Named Expressions.

**TODO**: Explain this hot mess some more.

### Layout and control flow

The only important external facing API is creating an Evaluator.
When you create one, the SPARQL Algebra expression that is passed will be transformed to an internal representation (see [Transformation.ts](./lib/Transformation.ts)). This will build objects (see [expressions module](./lib/expressions)) that contain all the logic and data for evaluation, for example the implementations for SPARQL functions (see [functions module](./lib/functions)). After transformation, the evaluator will recursively evaluate all the expressions.

### Type System

[See functions/Core.ts](./lib/functions/Core.ts)

The type system is tailored for doing (supposedly) quick evaluation of overloaded functions. A function object consists of a map of argument types to a concrete function implementation for those argument types.

When a function object is called with some functions, it looks up a concrete implementation. If we can not find one, we consider the argument of invalid types.

Since many derived types exist, we also associate every literal with it's primitive datatype when constructing a literal. This handles **subtype substitution**, as we define allowed types in function of these primitives types. Note: the derived type is not maintained after an operation on the term, since I found no functions for which this was relevant.

**Type promotion** is handled in a couple of ways. Firstly, a bit like C++ vtables, if we can not find a implementation for the concrete (primitive) types, we try to find an implementation for the term-types of all the arguments, if that fails, we look for an implementation on generic terms.

We also handle type promotion by explicitly coding for it. This is done in the arithmetic functions `+, -, *, /`.

### Testing

Running tests will generate a `test-report.html` in the root dir.
**TODO** Explain test organizatian and expression tables
