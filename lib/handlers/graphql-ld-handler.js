This is possible thanks to mapping languages which enable detaching mapping rules from the implementation that executes them. However, no thorough research has been conducted so far on how to visualize such mapping rules, especially if they become large and require considering multiple heterogeneous raw data sources and transformed data values. In the past, we proposed the RMLEditor, a visual graph-based user interface, which allows users to easily create mapping rules for generating Linked Data from raw data. In this paper, we build on top of our existing work: we (i) specify a visual notation for graph visualizations used to represent mapping rules, (ii) introduce an approach for manipulating rules when large visualizations emerge, and (iii) propose an approach to uniformly visualize data fraction of raw data sources combined with an interactive interface for uniform data fraction transformations. We perform two additional comparative user studies. The first one compares the use of the visual notation to present mapping rules to the use of a mapping language directly, which reveals that the visual notation is preferred. The second one compares the use of the graph-based RMLEditor for creating mapping rules to the form-based RMLx Visual Editor, which reveals that graph-based visualizations are preferred to create mapping rules through the use of our proposed visual notation and uniform representation of heterogeneous data sources and data values.","name":"Specification and Implementation of Mapping Rule Visualization and Editing: MapVOWL and the RMLEditor"},{"authors":[{"givenName":"Pieter","familyName":"Colpaert","id":"https://pietercolpaert.be/#me"},{"givenName":"Julián","familyName":"Rojas Meléndez","id":"https://julianrojas.org/#me"},{"givenName":"Gayane","familyName":"Sedrakyan","id":"https://data.verborgh.org/people/gayane_sedrakyan"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"}],"id":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-98192-5_28","about":[{"name":["World Wide Web","Web"]}],"isPartOf":{"name":"Proceedings of the 15th ESWC: Posters and Demos"},"abstract":"The road to publishing public streaming data on the Web is paved with trade-offs that determine its viability.

Furthermore, we demonstrate the initial developments of a Linked Time Series server that supports such features through an extensible modular architecture.

These languages are built with machine-processability in mind. It is thus not always straightforward for users to define or understand rules written in these languages, preventing them from applying the desired annotations to the data sources. In the past, graphical tools were proposed. However, next to users who prefer a graphical approach, there are users who desire to understand and define rules via a text-based approach. For the latter, we introduce an enhancement to their workflow. Instead of requiring users to manually write machine-processable rules, we propose writing human-friendly rules, and generate machine-processable rules based on those human-friendly rules. At the basis is YARRRML: a human-readable text-based representation for declarative generation rules. We propose a novel browser-based integrated development environment called “Matey”, showcasing the enhanced workflow. In this work, we describe our demo. Users can experience first hand how to generate triples from data in different formats by using YARRRML’s representation of the rules. The actual machine-processable rules remain completely hidden when editing. Matey shows that writing human-friendly rules enhances the workflow for a broader range of users. As a result, more desired annotations will be added to the data sources which leads to more desired Linked Data.","name":"Declarative Rules for Linked Data Generation at your Fingertips!"},{"authors":[{"givenName":"Sven","familyName":"Lieber","id":"https://sven-lieber.org/profile#me"},{"givenName":"Anastasia","familyName":"Dimou","id":"https://natadimou.com/#me"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"}],"id":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-98192-5_8","about":[{"name":["reuse","SPARQL","research"]}],"isPartOf":{"name":"Proceedings of the 15th ESWC: Posters and Demos"},"abstract":"Data management increasingly demands transparency with respect to data processing.

However, creating each of them manually or semi-automatically remains a repetitive and cognitively challenging task. We propose a data-driven approach that semantically represents the data processing itself as workflows and serves as a base for different kinds of result-sets, generated with SPARQL, i.e. DMPs. Our approach is threefold: (i) users with domain knowledge semantically represent workflow components; (ii) other users can reuse these components to describe their data processing via semantically enhanced workflows; and, based on the semantic workflows, (iii) result-sets are automatically generated on-demand with SPARQL queries. This paper demonstrates our tool that implements the proposed approach, based on a use-case of a researcher who needs to provide a DMP to a funding agency to approve a proposed research project.","name":"SeGoFlow: A Semantic Governance Workflow Tool"},{"authors":[{"givenName":"Thomas","familyName":"Steiner","id":"http://tomayac.com/thomas_steiner.rdf#me"},{"givenName":"Sam","familyName":"Coppens","id":"https://data.verborgh.org/people/sam_coppens"},{"givenName":"Rik","familyName":"Van de Walle","id":"https://data.verborgh.org/people/rik_van_de_walle"},{"givenName":"Joaquim","familyName":"Gabarró Vallés","id":"https://data.verborgh.org/people/joaquim_gabarro_valles"},{"givenName":"Erik","familyName":"Mannens","id":"https://data.verborgh.org/people/erik_mannens"},{"givenName":"Davy","familyName":"Van Deursen","id":"https://data.verborgh.org/people/davy_van_deursen"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"}],"id":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-46641-4","about":[{"name":["RESTdesc","REST","World Wide Web","Web"]}],"isPartOf":{"name":"The Semantic Web: ESWC 2012 Satellite Events"},"abstract":"If we want automated agents to consume the Web, they need to understand what a certain service does and how it relates to other services and data.

Web 2.0 connected humans with humans. Web 3.0 connects machines with machines.” On the one hand, an incredible amount of valuable data is described by billions of triples, machine-accessible and interconnected thanks to the promises of Linked Data. On the other hand, REST is a scalable, resource-oriented architectural style that, like the Linked Data vision, recognizes the importance of links between resources. Hypermedia APIs are resources, too—albeit dynamic ones—and unfortunately, neither Linked Data principles, nor the REST-implied self-descriptiveness of hypermedia APIs sufficiently describe them to allow for long-envisioned realizations like automatic service discovery and composition. We argue that describing inter-resource links—similarly to what the Linked Data movement has done for data—is the key to machine-driven consumption of APIs In this paper, we explain how the description format RESTdesc captures the functionality of APIs by explaining the effect of dynamic interactions, effectively complementing the Linked Data vision.","name":"Linked Data and Linked APIs: Similarities, Differences, and Challenges"},{"authors":[{"givenName":"Tom","familyName":"Creighton","id":"https://data.verborgh.org/people/tom_creighton"},{"givenName":"Sébastien","familyName":"Peyrard","id":"https://data.verborgh.org/people/sebastien_peyrard"},{"givenName":"Sam","familyName":"Coppens","id":"https://data.verborgh.org/people/sam_coppens"},{"givenName":"Rik","familyName":"Van de Walle","id":"https://data.verborgh.org/people/rik_van_de_walle"},{"givenName":"Rebecca","familyName":"Guenther","id":"https://data.verborgh.org/people/rebecca_guenther"},{"givenName":"Kevin","familyName":"Ford","id":"https://data.verborgh.org/people/kevin_ford"},{"givenName":"Erik","familyName":"Mannens","id":"https://data.verborgh.org/people/erik_mannens"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"}],"id":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00799-014-0136-9","about":[{"name":["archiving","provenance","metadata","World Wide Web","Web"]}],"isPartOf":{"name":"International Journal on Digital Libraries"},"abstract":"In this article, we present PREMIS OWL.

The (retrospective) provenance of such data is equally important because it contributes to the understanding of the relevance and trustworthiness of the information. Furthermore, computing provenance in a timely way is crucial for particular use cases and practitioners, such as online journalists that promptly need to assess particular pieces of information. Social media currently provide insufficient mechanisms for provenance tracking, publication and generation, while state-of-the-art on social media research focuses mainly on explicit diffusion mechanisms (like retweets in Twitter or reshares in Facebook).The implicit diffusion mechanisms remain understudied due to the difficulties of being captured and properly understood. From a technical side, the state of the art for provenance reconstruction evaluates small datasets after the fact, sidestepping requirements for scale and speed of current social media data. In this paper, we investigate the mechanisms of implicit information diffusion by computing its fine-grained provenance. We prove that explicit mechanisms are insufficient to capture influence and our analysis unravels a significant part of implicit interactions and influence in social media. Our approach works incrementally and can be scaled up to cover a truly Web-scale scenario like major events.

However, these constraint languages were designed with machine-processability in mind. Defining data shapes requires knowledge of the language’s syntax – usually RDF – and specification, which is not straightforward for domain experts, as they are not Semantic Web specialists. The notion of constraint languages is very recent: the W3C Recommendation for SHACL was finalized in 2017. Thus, user interfaces that enable domain experts to intuitively define such data shapes are not thoroughly investigated yet. In this paper, we present a non-exhaustive list of desired features to be supported by a user interface for editing data shapes. These features are applied to unSHACLed: a prototype interface with SHACL as its underlying constraint language.

These approaches cannot accurately validate RDF graphs, or combine multiple systems, deteriorating the validator’s performance. In this paper, we present an alternative validation approach using rule-based reasoning, capable of fully customizing the used inferencing steps. We compare to existing approaches, and present a formal ground and practical implementation “Validatrr”, based on N3Logic and the EYE reasoner. Our approach – supporting an equivalent number of constraint types compared to the state of the art – better explains the root cause of the violations due to the reasoner’s generated logical proof, and returns an accurate number of violations due to the customizable inferencing rule set. Performance evaluation shows that Validatrr is performant for smaller datasets, and scales linearly w.r.t. the RDF graph size. The detailed root cause explanations can guide future validation report description specifications, and the fine-grained level of configuration can be employed to support different constraint languages.

We also provide administrative and descriptive metadata in the same format by introducing a new ontology: Dicera. Our solution is complementary to the current extraction methods, on the one hand because they can help with metadata creation, and on the other hand because the machine-understandable metadata alleviates their use. While the reading system support for our solution is currently limited, it can offer all features needed by current comic distribution platforms.

In future work, our solution can be further improved by extending the presentation features, investigating different types of comics, studying the use of new EPUB 3 extensions, and by incorporating it in digital book authoring environments.","name":"Using EPUB 3 and the Open Web Platform for Enhanced Presentation and Machine-Understandable Metadata for Digital Comics"},{"authors":[{"givenName":"Pieter","familyName":"Heyvaert","id":"https://pieterheyvaert.com/#me"},{"givenName":"Anastasia","familyName":"Dimou","id":"https://natadimou.com/#me"},{"givenName":"Wouter","familyName":"Maroy","id":"https://data.verborgh.org/people/wouter_maroy"},{"givenName":"Gerald","familyName":"Haesendonck","id":"https://data.verborgh.org/people/gerald_haesendonck"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"}],"id":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3323878.3325802","about":[{"name":["RML","RDF"]}],"isPartOf":{"name":"Proceedings of the International Workshop on Semantic Big Data"},"abstract":"To unlock the value of increasingly available data in high volumes, we need flexible ways to integrate data across different sources.

In this paper, we analyze what aspects are parallelizable and we introduce an approach for parallel RDF generation. We describe how we implemented our proposed approach, in the frame of the RMLStreamer, and how the resulting scaling behavior compares to other RDF generators.

However, using Linking Data as a means to represent knowledge can be easier said than done. In this tutorial, we elaborate on the importance of semantically annotating data and how existing technologies facilitate their mapping to Linked Data. We introduce [R2]RML languages to generate Linked Data derived from different heterogeneous data sources (databases, XML, JSON, …) from different interfaces (documents, Web APIs, …). Those who are not Semantic Web experts can annotate their data with the RMLEditor, whose user interface hides all underlying Semantic Web technologies to data owners. Last, we show how to easily publish Linked Data on the Web as Triple Pattern Fragments. As a result, participants, independently of their knowledge background, can model, annotate and publish data on their own.","name":"Modeling, Generating, and Publishing Knowledge as Linked Data"},{"authors":[{"givenName":"Pieter","familyName":"Heyvaert","id":"https://pieterheyvaert.com/#me"},{"givenName":"Anastasia","familyName":"Dimou","id":"https://natadimou.com/#me"},{"givenName":"Rik","familyName":"Van de Walle","id":"https://data.verborgh.org/people/rik_van_de_walle"},{"givenName":"Erik","familyName":"Mannens","id":"https://data.verborgh.org/people/erik_mannens"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"},{"givenName":"Ruben","familyName":"Verborgh","id":"https://ruben.verborgh.org/profile/#me"}],"id":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-47602-5_25","about":[{"name":["RML","Linked Data generation","Linked Data","Semantic Web","World Wide Web","Web"]}],"isPartOf":{"name":"Proceedings of the 13th Extended Semantic Web Conference: Posters and Demos"},"abstract":"Linked Data is in many cases generated from (semi-)structured data.

Merging the input feeds is followed by enriching them. Besides determining the subjects of the datasets, using DBpedia Spotlight, two extensions were built: one categorizes the datasets according to a taxonomy, and the other adds spatial properties to the datasets. These extensions require the use of information available in DBpedia’s SPARQL endpoint. However, public SPARQL endpoints often suffer from low availability, so a Triple Pattern Fragments alternative is used.

Or maybe you want to get an overview whether there are less or more shops within the city centre after the introduction of the circulation plan?\\n\\nTo effectively allow machines to discover data about certain locations, we need to be able to efficiently query data using certain geospatial ranges. In this thesis, you have to design a solution that allows data to be looked up on the Web given certain geospatial ranges, this should be combinable with various other data sources on the Web to allow more complex queries to be answered. This will make it possible to ask questions like “Which bars are present that serve beer in a 5 km radius around my current locations?”, or “What is the closest bike repair shop between my home and the train station?”. We will build on existing work for Web querying, such as [Linked Data Fragments](http://linkeddatafragments.org/).\\n\\nBuilding a solution allowing data to be queried using certain geospatial ranges. Combining this data with other fragments on data on the Web to enable more complex queries. Evaluation of this solution compared to alternative approaches. One of these approaches is the [overpass turbo API](https://overpass-turbo.eu/) This API is able to query OpenStreetMap. We want to build a more efficient solution, by making sure the client also does a part of the query-processing."},"contactPoint":[{"id":"https://pietercolpaert.be/#me","mbox":"mailto:pieter@openknowledge.be","familyName":"Colpaert","givenName":"Pieter"}],"numberOfEmployees":{"maxValue":"2"}}]}]}`,

With the decentralization paradigm data is not centrally stored on a single company-controlled server, but across different servers controlled by individuals. For example, instead of storing all your pictures on the Facebook and Instagram servers so you can share them with your friends, decentralization allows you to store them on your own server, wherever it is located, and share them with whoever you want, without the need of a third party. Solid, created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, allows setting up such a decentralized approach.\\n\\nDifferent challenges arise when applying decentralization. One of them is authorization: how do you control who can view certain data. For example, how do you make sure that your friends can see your holiday pictures, but not your professors? In this master thesis, you will investigate how Solid is used in these situations and how you can integrate it in existing applications."},"contactPoint":[{"id":"https://pieterheyvaert.com/#me","mbox":"mailto:pieter.heyvaert@ugent.be","familyName":"Heyvaert","givenName":"Pieter"},{"id":"https://pieterheyvaert.com/#me","mbox":"mailto:pieter.heyvaert@ugent.be","familyName":"Heyvaert","givenName":"Pieter"},{"id":"https://pieterheyvaert.com/#me","mbox":"mailto:pieter.heyvaert@ugent.be","familyName":"Heyvaert","givenName":"Pieter"},{"id":"https://pieterheyvaert.com/#me","mbox":"mailto:pieter.heyvaert@ugent.be","familyName":"Heyvaert","givenName":"Pieter"}],"numberOfEmployees":{"maxValue":"1"}}]}]}`,

Dit gebeurt ook, maar de interoperabiliteit van de gepubliceerde data blijft een probleem. Zelfs een adres blijkt moeilijk te definiëren, en zelfs het data model van de Europese Commissie blijkt te generiek te zijn om alle adressen in België te definiëren. De Vlaamse overheid heeft een eigen vocabularium ontwikkeld om adressen te kunnen modelleren (<https://data.vlaanderen.be/ns/adres>), waarin ze 11 verschillende klassen nodig hebben om alle mogelijke gevallen te beschrijven. Het feit dat ieder land een eigen definitie van een adres heeft toont aan dat interoperabiliteit in de echte wereld al beperkt is. Als we Linked Data over de echte wereld interoperabel willen maken hoeven we dus twee problemen op te lossen; het technische en het maatschappelijke.\\n\\nEen alternatief is om dezelfde principes te gebruiken om een fictionele wereld te beschrijven, zodat we zelf kiezen hoe complex de maatschappelijke problemen zijn, maar vooral zodat we ons kunnen focusen op de technologie. Er is een categorie van spelletjes die men Collaborative Story Telling noemt, waarin we dezelfde principes als in Linked Data terug vinden. Iedereen kan stukken van een verhaal bijdragen aan een groter geheel, met de bedoeling dat het geheel consistent blijft. Dit zou een goed testbed kunnen zijn voor Linked Data technologie, waar we ons kunnen focusen op de technologie zelf, zonder de bagage van de echte wereld te moeten meesleuren, terwijl we toch rond iets concreets werken.\\n\\nWe hebben zelf al een aantal onderzoeksrichtingen in gedachten, maar ideaal zou zijn als studenten zelf met ideeën afkomen.\\n\\nEén ervan zou zich toeleggen op interoperabele geografische. Stel dat een persoon een gebouw, een buurt, of een stad ontwerpt - hoe kunnen anderen dit design integreren in een bestaande wereld? Wat als de schaal van twee kaarten verschilt, of wat als twee locaties van twee verschillende bronnen overlappen?\\n\\nOmdat er iets inherent sociaal is aan het onderwerp is onderzoek naar het gebruik van Solid (Social Linked Data) ook zeker een mogelijkheid. Stel dat je een Role Playing Game zoals Dungeons and Dragons speelt, wat wordt er mogelijk als je ieder personage een eigen Solid POD geeft? Hier worden voor de permissies interessant, wie kan er wat lezen van welke personages, en wie kan er schrijven naar waar? Voor meer informatie kunnen we zeker deze blog post van onze eigen professor Verborgh aanbevelen: <https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2019/06/17/shaping-linked-data-apps/>.\\n\\nHet zou ook interessant zijn om een referentie vocabularium op te stellen voor dit soort spelletjes. Veel Role Playing Games, en andere collaborative storytelling games, gelijken op elkaar - maar zijn toch niet helemaal hetzelfde. Het zou nochtans interessant kunnen zijn om personages of locaties die voor het ene systeem ontworpen zijn over te brengen naar een ander systeem. Veel van deze games bouwen bewust op clichés, zodat het in theorie mogelijk is om systeem-specifieke concepten om te zetten naar clichés en vice versa."},"contactPoint":[{"id":"https://pietercolpaert.be/#me","mbox":"mailto:pieter@openknowledge.be","familyName":"Colpaert","givenName":"Pieter"}],"numberOfEmployees":{"maxValue":"1"}}]}]}`,

However, despite how common they are now, there are still some open problems. Giving the option to prioritize scenic routes when the weather’s nice for example, or avoiding streets that are too narrow for bidirectional traffic but are the result of bad urban planning. Client-side route planning could be used to solve these problems because the computation happens on the end-user’s side, so they can tweak any parameter they want.\\n\\nWe have been prototyping this principle over the past couple of years, where all relevant data is published in fragments on the Web, so that clients can pick and choose which data they use. For instance, we have published the road network from OpenStreetMap in tiles of roughly 4 km², and separate mobility profiles determine how the road network is to be translated to a weighted directional graph. A mobility profile for old-timers for example could be set to avoid highways, while one for scooters could be set to avoid cobblestones if possible. \\n\\nDeveloping these prototypes into functioning applications has been a challenge however. On one side, we have been working in Javascript so far because of our dependency on resources on the Web. Javascript was never meant for heavy computations, making the end product too slow for end-users. Moreover, there are several platforms that support Javascript -- but code written for one platform does not necessarily work for the others. In practice this means that we now have a route planner that works in browser environments, but that does not work in any of the mobile frameworks. \\n\\nWebAssembly may fix both problems at the same time. On one hand, it is meant for heavy computational loads, and should in theory be nearly as efficient as regular binary executables, especially compared to Javascript. On the other hand, WebAssembly is so minimalistic that it may very well be more portable than Javascript. There are no dependencies to platform specific standard libraries as there are no standard libraries. \\n\\nWe want to know how mature the WebAssembly ecosystem is. Specifically, we want to know if there are enough libraries to work around the lack of standard library, e.g. can we make asynchronous HTTP requests? There are several projects developing WebAssembly toolchains in parallel, such as Rust’s wasm-bindgen and C/C++’s Emscripten, so the answer to the previous question might not be a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Assuming one of the toolchains is sufficiently mature, we also want to know what the performance impact is, as there will always be some inevitable overhead to client-side data processing.\\n\\nThis project involves a lot of software development, but there is plenty of room for research if so desired. On one hand, WebAssembly is new, and the community is still working towards established best practices. An understanding of the underlying VM, and how programming languages compile to it, is instrumental to benefit from its theoretical benefits. On the other hand, the end goal is an application that is nearly as efficient as relying on online services, even if it is only in very specific circumstances such as short-distance routes. Achieving this will require more than a fast execution environment, the underlying algorithms are at least as important."},"contactPoint":[{"id":"https://pietercolpaert.be/#me","mbox":"mailto:pieter@openknowledge.be","familyName":"Colpaert","givenName":"Pieter"}],"numberOfEmployees":{"maxValue":"1"}}]}]}`,

We believe the Semantic Web needs applications beyond traditional Information Retrieval tasks, while recommender systems can benefit from structured data to generate diverse, but coherent, sequences of results.\\n\\nRecommending Points of Interest is one of the traditional use cases for recommender systems. For instance, the organizers of one of the first conferences on recommender systems built an application to recommend good restaurants to their attendees. Nowadays, a lot of research focuses on generating sequences of locations, as one might generate a musical playlist. This “more of the same” approach leads to monotonous itineraries which are to itineraries what fruit salads are to salads; not bad under certain circumstances, but ultimately pretty basic.\\n\\nIdeally, an itinerary has a certain balance of Points of Interest: you might want to interleave coffee houses in between long walks, plan a restaurant around dinner time, add some detours to visit historical locations, …. Knowing the difference between similar and complementary locations, how long one might stay at a location, and when one might visit a location requires domain knowledge beyond what common sequential recommender systems use. This is where the knowledge graphs come in: the relations between the different kinds of locations can be modelled using an ontology, giving the recommender systems the assurances that certain locations fit together despite not being similar.\\n\\nThere is a more fundamental problem we need to tackle first though: there are no publicly accessible sources of high-quality Point of Interest information. Which is why we propose to start on a small, and self-contained, domain where we can create our own data to try out techniques that can later be applied to the real world.\\n\\nWe propose to work on a fictional world, such as one from Dungeons and Dragons, to work on both the data modeling and recommender tasks simultaneously without getting lost in the details of either subtask. There are more similarities between these domains than one might think: an encounter in Dungeons and Dragons requires diversity to be challenging, some creature types and more likely to occur together, and contextual factors such as the time of day influence which creatures one might encounter. Insights from generating interesting encounters can then be translated to generating interesting itineraries in the real world, once the data becomes available. Likewise, insights in how to model this fictional data will highlight precisely which kinds of Points of Interest is required later on.\\n\\nConcretely, this subject has two core tasks: (i) data modelling and (ii) reasoning over the data. We do not expect the former to be the main challenge; although data models for knowledge graphs come with their own specific terminology, it is essentially the same as developing any other data model. The second task allows for more freedom; with possible approaches ranging from logic-based systems such as Case-Based Reasoning, to Few-Shot Learning, or genetic programming. We are not even limited to composing interesting encounters because this is the most similar to generating itineraries in the real world. The same ideas may be used to generate individual creatures as well, as each creature in Dungeons and Dragons is also just the sum of its properties -- properties we can recombine to create new creatures."},"contactPoint":[{"id":"https://pietercolpaert.be/#me","mbox":"mailto:pieter@openknowledge.be","familyName":"Colpaert","givenName":"Pieter"}],"numberOfEmployees":{"maxValue":"1"}}]}]}`,

You decide to go hiking in the Ardennes, possibly for the first time since graduating high school. There are sites that publish hiking trails you can follow, so you pick one with good reviews that looks sufficiently challenging because you have barely left your house in half a year and want to feel alive again. The instructions say to follow the yellow triangle, which you do for a few hours, until you get to an intersection where you have to choose between a blue square or a red circle. Confusion fades into the realization that you missed a sign somewhere. You have always been able to rely on Google Maps to get you home, but this time it’s just showing you’re in the middle of an unnamed green shape as they never mapped these hiking trails. You are alone.\\n\\nChances are you’ll still find your way home, most hiking trails in the Ardennes aren’t that long and you there are plenty of other hikers to ask for guidance. Still, it would be nice to be able to have an application on your phone that could tell you which trails to follow if you want to get home. A more experienced hiker might already have a GPS tracking application on their phone, which they use to never get off-track -- but where is the fun in that? You went hiking to stop staring at screens the entire time, you want to look at the outside world for once.\\n\\nWhat you really want is a route planning application that shows you the way, but can adapt the route when you inevitably make a mistake. Hiking trails aren’t well defined like regular roads are, so we cannot simply build a network graph and rely on established route planning algorithms. However, there are numerous sources of GPS traces of people’s hikes, and if we can extract an estimated network graph out of these, we can plan routes over them.\\n\\nThe goal of this research is to extract a network graph from GPS traces, building the actual route planning application is optional but welcome. Many municipalities and intercommunales publish traces on their own websites, which are free to use for any purpose. We would propose to focus on a single region with a sufficiently high amount of hiking trails, with traces from different sources as not all of the traces will be of the same quality.\\n\\nAs we would rely on open data, we want the resulting network graph to be publishable as open data as well. This would enable other applications, such as the OpenStreetMap project, to potentially integrate these trails as well. We currently have a Linked Data vocabulary to publish the road network from OpenStreetMap, which may be used as an inspiration to publish the hiking trails as well."},"contactPoint":[{"id":"https://pietercolpaert.be/#me","mbox":"mailto:pieter@openknowledge.be","familyName":"Colpaert","givenName":"Pieter"}],"numberOfEmployees":{"maxValue":"1"}}]}]}`,

Companies, start-ups, organisations, and governments all require some of our data to provide us with the services we want and need. This has led to an increased power for big platform players like Google, Facebook, etc.\\n\\nAn alternative solution could be based on a new ecosystem of personal data, in which every person has their own personal data vault, which we refer to as a data pod. Think of a data pod as a virtual drive to which you as an individual hold the keys. Your data pod can then store and safeguard the data that you produce as well as the data that companies and organisations produce about you. As the controller of your data pod, you can decide for every piece of data which parties you want to share it with. This way, companies can get access to specific data without writing or collecting it themselves, while respecting every individual’s preferences. The SOLID standard provides a very promising solution for the potential implementation of personal data pods and the ecosystem around it.\\n\\nOpting for this set-up of the ecosystem can reshape the existing power relations, it can enable innovation by small players and it can provide an opportunity for the government to set some standards for the way this data is structured, stored and shared.The goal of this thesis is to improve the understanding of the cost structure behind the SOLID solution and to understand the impact of the different approaches the government can take towards implementing this solution on the resulting cost-benefit trade-off (e.g. will they force service providers to implement data pods according to the SOLID standard or will they centralize the data pods and force service providers to communicate with this centralized solution, etc.). The research within this thesis consists of several steps:\\n\\n- Description of the SOLID solution as a multi-sided platform consisting of at least 3 user segments: citizens/customer, data pod providers (e.g. government, but potentially also private data providers), service providers in different application domains (mostly private). Comparison of this situation to current situations, e.g. where a Dropbox or Google account provides access to different apps/services.\\n- Identification of value of SOLID towards different users (apps, services), identification of what incentivizes them to sync to datapods rather than duplicating this information in their own platforms.\\n- Overview of cost structure of the SOLID implementation, including infrastructure cost (shared platform cost versus direct cost related to a certain service offer, fixed platform cost versus variable cost related to the adding a single customers, ..) and process cost to set-up and maintain the SOLID-based data ecosystem. Next to that, also the costs at the different user sides (citizens, service providers, data providers) will be investigated. This can e.g. highlight a reduced transaction cost for a customer when he switches from one service to a competing one, or the loss of control and related increased costs for a big commercial platform that will no longer be storing personalized data on its own servers or will no longer be sending this data over its own backbone network.\\n- Identification of different potential scenarios for the role of the government, e.g. setting up a actual data utility company and quantifying the related potential cost-benefit trade-offs.\\n\\nWhereas the first steps include conceptual research, based on literature review, discussions with potential stakeholders and providing qualitative insights, the later steps in the thesis include making quantitative assessments about cost impact based on a software implementation of the cost model. The overall outcome of the thesis can lead to actual guidelines for governments on how to behave within the new data ecosystem.\\n\\n<img alt=\\"\\"

The level of comfort of the daily journeys we take, have a significant impact on our quality of life. For this reason, considerable efforts have been dedicated to develop route planning applications that provide information about the best alternatives to go from one place to another. However, every person has her/his own unique preferences and requirements when travelling, and current route planning applications are not able to consider all the different aspects that comprise a person’s mobility when calculating possible journey plans. Achieving truly personalized route planning requires applications to access and integrate data about mobility preferences (e.g. preferred modes of transport, public transport subscriptions, favorite routes, etc) and needs (e.g. wheelchair access, secure parking, vehicle restrictions, etc), while complying with data privacy requirements and policies such as GDPR.\\n\\nIn this project we aim to design and implement a privacy-aware solution for truly personalized route planning. Using the Web as our platform, we aim to provide the users with tailored route planning advice while allowing them to keep ownership and control over their personal data. This requires the definition of a flexible and interoperable data model that can be integrated into decentralized and privacy-aware data architectures such as Solid, and also the understanding and implementation of state-of-the-art route planning algorithms into Web-based journey planners such as Planner.js. Join us for an exciting project and help people to have a comfortable and happy journey.\\n\\nExample of client-side route planning by downloading the data on the fly:\\n\\n<img alt=\\"Contraction hierarchies on Web data\\" src=\\"https://data.knows.idlab.ugent.be/person/office/img/master-theses/25036-contractions.gif\\" style=\\"height:689px; width:934px\\">"},"contactPoint":[{"id":"https://pietercolpaert.be/#me","mbox":"mailto:pieter@openknowledge.be","familyName":"Colpaert","givenName":"Pieter"}],"numberOfEmployees":{"maxValue":"1"}}]}]}`,
